            <p class="paragraph-text justify-text">
                I am a self-taught programmer with a strong foundation in Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and C#, and extensive experience in backend development. While I have skills across both frontend and backend, my primary focus is building efficient, scalable solutions. I am actively seeking an entry-level role where I can contribute my skills, continue to grow as a developer, and add value to the team.

                My programming journey began with MIT’s App Inventor, where I quickly grasped the fundamentals and created a clicker app that exceeded expectations. I continued to push myself, learning new languages and building personal projects like a 2D Minecraft clone. In high school, I expanded my knowledge in languages such as JS, PHP, C++, and C#, and worked on projects like an Arduino-controlled car and a custom LED controller. During this time, I also designed a website for my father's company.

                In my final year, I discovered Python and quickly fell in love with its simplicity and powerful libraries. I taught myself the math behind neural networks and developed an AI that outperformed the original Pong game AI using a generational evolution algorithm. Since then, I’ve continued working on projects in my free time, including assisting a nonprofit organization with their programming needs. Though my career has been in sales, I am eager to transition into a full-time programming role.

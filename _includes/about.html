            <p class="paragraph-text justify-text">
                I am 24 years old, and I live in Alberta, Canada. I enjoy a vast array of hobbies; including snowboarding, boating, dirt biking, gaming, and spending time with friends and family. I enjoy spending time in nature and am curious about the universe and the world around me. I prided myself in being in the top of my class all the way through high school, and was first introduced to programming when I was in grade 10.

                My love for programming began in the first class I ever took about it. I started with app inventor and made a basic clicker app as my first real project in the first 2 weeks of the class. The teacher told me I had gone above and beyond, and managed to incorporate about half of the curriculum in that one project. This became a trend for me. As I continued in the class, I found programming to be very intuitive and easy for my logical mind to grasp. In about 2 months I taught myself the entire curriculum and spent my free time working on other projects. One of my best from that year was a Game Maker app that was basically a 2D Minecraft Clone. It included procedural world generation, with trees and ore veins, and basic crafting.

                In grade 11, I once again studied ahead and finished the curriculum in 2 months, but then went further and completed the Grade 12 curriculum as well before the end of the year. At this point I began acting as a teaching assistant, helping to answer other students questions and assisting them with their projects. My time in grade 11 was spent broadening my knowledge, learning JS, HTML, CSS, PHP, C++, C#, and a little bit of Java. I also worked on several Arduino projects, including a car that detected and followed a line on the ground, and a controller for addressable Leds with custom light patterns and the ability to communicate over Bluetooth. This was also the year I designed a website for my Fathers company.

                Having completed the majority of the Grade 12 curriculum the year before, I had a lot more free time during that class. I still used up nearly every lunch and the free time in other classes to keep working on projects and just generally learning as much as I could. I played around with Unity and Unreal Engine, but when I discovered Python, I fell in love. The formatting made programming faster, and the available libraries were incredibly powerful and useful. I first discovered python when researching Neural Networks. I was mesmerized by the concept and committed to making one of my own. I learned that PyGame and Numpy were two highly valuable libraries in python that would help me make it, so I decided to learn the new language instead of sticking with JS as I normally did before. In order to create my own Neural Network, I also taught myself Calculus to be able to understand the math behind how it works. I settled on a clone of Atari's Pong, and used a generational evolution algorithm I developed myself to train the neural network. It took about 6 weeks of working around the clock, but when I was finished, the AI was clearly able to learn the game and it outperformed the original game's AI most of the time.

            <p class="paragraph-text justify-text">
                I am a self-taught programmer with a strong foundation in multiple programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and C#. I also have experience with web design, NodeJS, and some others, however Python is my strongest language including many of its libraries. While I have experience across both frontend and backend development, my primary focus is backend development, where I strive to build efficient, scalable solutions. I am actively seeking an entry-level position where I can contribute my skills, continue to learn, and grow as a developer, while delivering value to the team and company!

                I am 23 years old, and I live in Alberta, Canada. I enjoy a vast array of hobbies; including snowboarding, boating, dirt biking, gaming, and spending time with friends and family. I enjoy spending time in nature and am curious about the universe and the world around me. I prided myself in being in the top of my class all the way through high school, and was first introduced to programming when I was in grade 10.

                My love for programming began in the first class I ever took of it. I started with MIT's App Inventor and made a basic clicker app as my first real project in the first 2 weeks of the class. The teacher told me I had gone above and beyond, and managed to incorporate about half of the curriculum in that one project. This became a bit of a trend for me. As I continued in the class, I found programming to be very intuitive and easy to grasp. In about 2 months I taught myself the entire curriculum and spent my free time working on personal projects to grow my knowledge further. One of my best from that year was a Game Maker app that was basically a 2D Minecraft Clone. It included procedural world generation, with trees and ore veins, and basic crafting.

                In grade 11, I once again studied ahead and finished the curriculum in 2 months, but then went further and completed most of the Grade 12 curriculum as well before the end of the year. At this point I began acting as a teaching assistant, helping to answer other students questions and assisting them with their projects. My time in grade 11 was spent broadening my knowledge, learning JS, HTML, CSS, PHP, C++, C#, and a little bit of Java. I also worked on several Arduino projects, including a car that detected and followed a line on the ground, and a controller for addressable Leds with custom light patterns and the ability to communicate over Bluetooth. This was also the year I designed a website for my Fathers company.

                Having completed the majority of the Grade 12 curriculum the year before, I had a lot more free time during that class. I played around with Unity and Unreal Engine, but when I discovered Python, I fell in love. The formatting made programming faster, and the available libraries were incredibly powerful and useful. I first discovered python when researching Neural Networks. I was mesmerized by the concept and committed to making one of my own. I learned that PyGame and Numpy were two highly valuable libraries in python that would help me make it, so I decided to learn the new language instead of sticking with JS as I normally did before. In order to create my own Neural Network, I also taught myself Calculus to be able to understand the math behind how it works. I settled on a clone of Atari's Pong, and used a generational evolution algorithm I developed myself to train the neural network. It took about 6 weeks of working around the clock, but when I was finished, the AI was clearly able to learn the game and it outperformed the original game's AI consistently.

                My time since has been doing what projects I can in my free time to reinforce my skills and understanding. I have spent some time working with a non profit company, performing some of the programming they needed, and assisting their primary dev in his work. Though I've made my income primarily through sales positions, being able to turn my passion for programming and development into a career is my dream.
